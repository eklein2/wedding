##It all started with a Craigslist ad&hellip;
  
No, not that section of Craigslist. The rooms for rent section. Mike's roommate Nell had just moved out and he did not want to leave his new favorite neighborhood, so he went in search of a new roommate. Meanwhile, somewhere in the Upper East Side, Emily was saying goodbye to Claire who was on her way back to San Francisco. Done with the construction of the Second Ave. subway, she decided to give Brooklyn a try.
  
> I don't know Lucy, I think she may be the one.

Their first meeting was magical. Actually it was predictably awkward. He promised her movies on the roof&mdash;never happened. She told Lucy that she was excited to live with her&mdash;bold since he hadn't offered her the apartment yet. They parted ways and Michael knew Emily was right person to share the apartment. Little did he know they would wind up sharing their lives together.

As roommates, Em and Mike clicked right away. They shared coffee in the morning, took Lucy on walks together, and reminisced about growing up in New Jersey. One such conversation led to a decision to play hooky and visit Liberty Science Center, a field trip staple. To celebrate their new found irresponsibility, Em and Mike went to Ceol, a favorite neighborhood pub. It was that night that they had their first kiss--which apparently everyone they knew had already predicted would happen.

Over the next five years they turned their little apartment into a home, now with a guest room. There's been graduate school, new jobs, fire escape gardens, and countless Saturdays at the dog park. They've become apart of each other's families and gained new friends. And since the beginning both Em and Mike knew this was something special. It was time to make it official.

> I'm here. People at the bar are deconstructing Home Alone.

December 5: Mike receives a text from Emily telling him she just got to the bar where they were to meet. He was late and trying to get a cab in the rain but everything was set. Henry had given his blessing. The errant text message that almost spoiled the surprise had been caught just in time. The ring, made from a favorite necklace of Emily's mother, was burning a hole in his pocket. He had told her he wanted to take her out since they hadn't been on a nice date in a while.

After a cocktail and discussing the homework Mike knew Emily wouldn't be doing that weekend, they went off to dinner in the West Village. They walked into the cute Italian restaurant Em's brother had recommended and were asked if they had a reservation. 

"I didn't think you took reservations." Mike replied. 

"Oh we only take reservations, no walk-ins."

Not a great start, but Mike had a backup plan. There was another restaurant just seven blocks away. Trudging through the rain, Emily suggested just getting pizza and doing the date another time. Mike would usually jump at the chance to get a slice, but tonight he insisted. 

> Were you nervous? Well, I knocked the silverware off the table four times at dinner tonight.

After dinner, Mike suggested grabbing an Uber home since it was so nasty out. The nice thing about Uber cars is that you set your destination ahead of time, which works out well if you want to surprise your girlfriend with a hotel room for the evening. They hop in the car and come to a stop in TriBeCa.

"Why is he stopping here?" Em asked.

"Oh just get out of the car."

They walk into their hotel room and on the bed is an album that Mike had made with photos of their five years together and all the reasons why he knew they were right for each other. The last page of the album stated, "So let's make this official." Mike dropped to one knee and completely flubbed the speech he had been practicing in his head all week. But it didn't matter. She said yes!

The little pub where they first kissed is now gone, but what began that night endures and Emily and Michael would be thrilled if you could celebrate with them as they commit their lives to each other.
